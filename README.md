# Employee Reimbursement API

# Description
In a fast-paced work environment there are often situations 
where employees find themselves covering the cost of things 
necessary for doing the job. Whether it be for gas, office supplies
or a new software package many employers would agree that their employees 
should be reimbursed for such purchases. However, it can be 
very time-consuming for employers to have to sift through their email to find
and respond to reimbursement requests, especially if it is a large company.
This is why we decided to go ahead and create a back-end API for handling 
transactions and managing reimbursements.

# Usage
The functionality of our back-end API was designed to be used by three different
types of users; admin users, finance managers, and employees. It uses HTTP requests 
for its functionality. Admin users are able to activate and deactivate users as well
as delete and add new users. Once approved by the admin employees can submit 
reimbursement requests as well as view all their requests and the respective information
about those requests. Finance managers have the ability to approve or deny reimbursement
requests, they can also view all the requests they have received and their respective
information.

# Project Brief
For the foundations module of your training you are tasked with building an API that will 
support a new internal expense reimbursement system. This system will manage the process 
of reimbursing employees for expenses incurred while on company time. All registered 
employees in the company can login and submit requests for reimbursement and view their 
past tickets and pending requests. Finance managers can log in and view all reimbursement 
requests and past history for all employees in the company. Finance managers are authorized 
to approve and deny requests for expense reimbursement.
